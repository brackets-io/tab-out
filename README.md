# Tab Out
Use the Tab key to jump out of groupings after closing characters ", ', ), ] and } like in Eclipse.

# Usage
Try to type the following JavaScript line in Brackets and use the Tab key to leave the strings, objects and array:

`var test = [{'key1': "value1", 'key2': "value2"}];`

WARNING: You may find this more fun to type than having to reach for the right arrow key or pressing the corresponding characters like you are playing a game for 3-year-olds ;-)
